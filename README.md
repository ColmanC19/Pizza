Setup/Installation Requirements
Using your terminal you can git clone this project to your desktop.

Then you will call the directory using your terminal, make sure you're in the desktop and cd "project name here"

If you don't wish to make any changes you can simply double click the index.html inside that cloned directory and it will open an html page in your internet browser.
